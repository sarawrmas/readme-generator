## Description 

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all.

With this README generator, you no longer need to create a professional README from scratch. Simply answer a few questions and watch as a README is created before your very eyes.

    * What problem does it solve?
    * What did you learn?
    * What makes your project stand out?

* **Installation:** What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

* **Contributing:** If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

* **Credits:** 
    * List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. Don't forget to include your own name!
