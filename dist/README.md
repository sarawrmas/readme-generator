  ## Description
  Jest Another RPG is a simple role-playing game run from the command line. It uses the Jest Package from Node Package Manager to run tests for the functionality. Follow instructions below to start a new game! As you cycle through three different enemies, you have the option to attack or take a potion to increase your health, strength, or agility. Try to beat all three enemies and live to see the end of the game!

  ## Installation
  Clone link from repo, use command "npm init" to install Node Package Manager making sure to insert "jest" for the test value, and finally install jest using command "npm install jest --save-dev"

  ## Usage
  Once software is downloaded and Node packages are initialized, it's time to get started! Within the directory for this project, start the game by using the command "node app.js". From there, simply follow the prompts to select moves for your player. Game will continue until you are either defeated by your enemies or emerge victorious!

  ## Contributing
  If you see something in the game that could be improved, such as more appropriate attack and strength values that would lead to an easier or more challenging game, you can submit bug and feature requests, or make pull requests with updated code so I can review your changes.

  ## Tests
  There are three test files for this application. The Potion test file checks for the creation of potions to ensure players receive their potions on game start and at the beginning of each new battle. The Player and Enemy test files check that each new character was successfully added to the game, and that their respective functions work properly. To run a test, use the command "npm run test *file name*" to test only one file, or "npm run test" to run every test at once.
