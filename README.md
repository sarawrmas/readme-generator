# Acceptance Criteria

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests~~

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

~~WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile~~

~~WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions~~
